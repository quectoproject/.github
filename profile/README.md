> **It’s not an embedded Linux distribution,
it creates a custom one for you.**

The Quecto Project is an open source collaboration project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems that are designed for embedded products regardless of the product’s hardware architecture. Quecto Project provides a flexible toolset and a development environment that allows embedded device developers across the world to collaborate through shared technologies, software stacks, configurations, and bad practices used to create these tailored Linux images.
